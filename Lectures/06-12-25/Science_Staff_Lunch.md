Adam
* CHIME telescope (in BC, CA): main benefit is large FOV (Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment)
* Detect FRBs, Pulsars
* Pulsars as laboratories for gravitational properties (i.e. GWs)
* Field consensus: FRBs from neutron stars w/ very very high magnetic fields, drawing energy from those fields

Toney Minter - Zeeman Observations
* QM on large scale to study magnetic fields
* Orientation of HI atom undergoing spin flip (i.e. 21 cm) can matter; if spin flip system is aligned vs. anti-aligned w external field; Splits into two energy levels
* 21cm line emits polarized, but cancelled out by randomness in space. With field, however, seperated (aligned vs. anti-aligned) very slightly but still measurable
* Gas cloud collisions/interactions w/ mag. field
* TLDR: Splitting of E levels informs mag. field, can study distant magnetic fields!

Emily Moravec - Radio AGN in Galaxy Clusters
* Studying effects on galaxies from their neighbors
* Galaxy clusters: 80-90% DM, 10-15% Intra-cluster medium, rest is actual galaxies
* Gal. clusters: some of largest scale structure known in the universe
* AGN: SMBH at center of galaxies emits jets in radio ejected normal to accretion disk
* Radio AGN can be found in gal. clusters and ID'd in radio, xray, optical, etc. but Emily focuses on radio
* More radio AGN than other types, and earlier universe also has more radio than more recent
* AGN jets can eject into ICM, imparting energy into medium, which can then affect size and shape of jets
* Questions: Does dynamical state of a galaxy cluster affect radio-AGN, and if so, how? How are properties of radio AGN affected by merging galaxy clusters?

Jacob Turner -- Pulsars/Cyclic Spectroscopy
* Pulsars: lab for GW, but also valuable for studying small scale structure of ISM (scale of 1 AU)
* Sensitivity to GW requires high resolution in pulse phase, but ISM study relies on frequency resolution
* Uncertainty relation between time and frequency (Gabor limit). True for all natural signals EXCEPT periodic signals (i.e. pulsars!)
* Inverse relation b/n width of scintillation structures and scattering in data
* 2-D Fourier Transform of dynamical spectra --> secondary spectra; with enough resolution, 'scintillation arcs' can be resolved in time-frequency space
* Omits RFI because periodic reading will not show RFI unless RFI matches periodicity

Jay Lockman (Felix J. Lockman) -- HI CLouds in the Fermi Bubbles
* SMBH at center of all large gals
* Jets from those SMBHs emits jets; rich in iron and other gas which is ejected
* 1-10 Million degree winds from MW SMBH
* HI clouds stripped from center of MW are tracers for winds away from SMBH which is otherwise very hard to detect
* HII, for example, likely orders of magnitude too weak to detect
* Fastest moving Hydrogen clouds we know of in the MW are in bubble moving away from us

Riley Dunnagan -- 3mm ALMA Survey of M0.10-0.08 ('M10')
* Many large clouds do not form many large stars
* Found 31 molecules (looked for 13) with ALMA
* Studying chemical abundance ratios
* Potential accretion outflow in M10

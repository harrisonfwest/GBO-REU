RAMPS: Surveys mid-plane with ammonia, sees weaker correlation between clump size and turbulent velocity dispersion than suggested by Larson (1980)

Larson (1980): Mostly 13CO, but surveys objects outside of the milky way

Investigating if the CMZ behaves weirdly despite inflow of otherwise typical dust, or if the inflow of dust with weird behavior/properties
causes the CMZ to behave weirdly
If objects outside the milky way show a stronger trend (note that Larson had much smaller sample size than RAMPS), could imply that
    the clumps in the milky way are different to those outside. Could imply unique composition or behavior of milky way relative to other bodies


Sormani/Barnes: Ideas of note for future interest
    "There are very little direct observational constraints on the amount of gas raining from the circumgalactic medium"

    "Unless the bar is much younger than currently believed, some gas replenishment must take place in the region just outside the bar. 
    This may be considered an indirect evidence for the presence of radial flows within the disc of our Galaxy which bring the gas down 
    to the outskirts of the Galactic bar. The mechanism by which this happens is unclear and deserves further investigation"


Ammonia: Hyperfine structure creates quadrupole sattelite lines (two spectral lines on either side of the main line) in any given transition
Ratio of two transitions informs temperature (relative amplitudes of transition spectra are proportional to temperature, analogous to Boltzmann distribution of states)
Ratio of main line to satellite lines informs optical depth (relative to some ideal from lab conditions)

Hyperfine structure cont.: From lab, known expected ratios between main line and sattelite lines, with deviation from this expectation informing optical depth.
Ratio of transition line amplitudes (i.e. (1,1) vs. (2,2)) informs temperature via a Boltzmann distribution-based partition function of relative occupanies
of possible energy states.

(J, K) transition: Magnetic quantum number, projection of magnetization onto axis of symmetry of the molecule

FWHM = 2 sqrt(2 * ln(2)) * sigma; FWHM ~ 2.35 * sigma
